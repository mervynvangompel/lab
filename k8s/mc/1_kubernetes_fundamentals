First: VMs
2013: Docker: separate things from OS
  Applications got containerized: multiple containers share compute on one VM
  Less VMs to manage
  Containers are light, scalable and compartamentalized
What if we want replicas to handle more request?
  provisioning with ansible playbooks: install docker, run container etc
  issue: how to route traffic (containers are unaware of each other)?
  HAProxy loadbalancer: round robin routing to VM, which routes it to container
  Complex and manual
Kubernetes solves the issue of managing these containers
  OS of the cloud
  a bunch of VMs who are able to communicate properly with each other and divide their workload
  Under the hood: still VMs with Ubuntu
  But with control plane
  Those VMs are now "worker nodes"
  YAML file: "hey kubernetes, I want 3 replicas of image xyz".
  Control plane takes that request, checks availability and capacity of the worker nodes to distribute the work.
  Tell K8S a certain state and it will figure it out (desired state as opposed to imperative).
  K8S can also add nodes if needed if out of capacity.
  Self-healing
  K8S runs container workloads at scale
  e.g. readers of newspapers: most active between 8am and 10am: planned / unplanned scaling out based on cpu or other metric
